    <h1>Home Extensions</h1>

    <p>Home extensions provide the extra space families need â€” extended kitchens, dining rooms or ground-floor expansions. TradeMatch connects you with builders, architects and project managers experienced in extensions, ensuring planning, structural works and finishes are managed professionally.</p>

    <h2>Types of extensions</h2>
    <p>Common types include single-storey rear extensions, side returns, wrap-around extensions and two-storey additions. Each project has different planning and structural requirements â€” our local pros can advise on cost-effective options.</p>

    <h2>How to get accurate quotes</h2>
    <p>Share existing plans or sketches, proposed layout, and any known planning constraints. Tradespeople will typically provide site visits before finalising budgets.</p>
