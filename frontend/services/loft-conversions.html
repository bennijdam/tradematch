    <h1>Loft Conversions</h1>

    <p>Loft conversions are a popular way to add living space without extending the footprint of your home. On TradeMatch, you can connect with local loft conversion contractors who offer design, structural work, insulation, stairs and finishing. Whether you're planning a dormer loft, mansard conversion or rooflight solution, our network includes professionals who specialise in loft conversions across the UK.</p>

    <h2>Why choose a loft conversion?</h2>
    <p>A loft conversion typically delivers high value for homeowners â€” increased living space, improved property value and minimal disruption to garden or external footprint. Typical uses include extra bedrooms, home offices, or en-suite additions.</p>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Expect site surveys, structural design and planning checks where necessary. Contractors often provide a phased quote: survey & design, structural works and finishings. Timelines can vary between 4â€“12 weeks depending on complexity.</p>

    <h2>Get the best quotes</h2>
    <p>To get accurate quotes, include floor area, desired layout, measurements and photos. TradeMatch allows you to upload photos and project details and receive multiple quotes from verified loft conversion specialists.</p>
